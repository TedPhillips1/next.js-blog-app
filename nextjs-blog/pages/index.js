          Hi, I'm Ted, a junior full-stack developer with a passion for making
          great things. After a failed shopify venture in my final year of uni
          (a Bsc in Biomedical Science at the University of Warwick) I realised
          that I don't want to flog cheap products from China and if I really
          want to make a difference in the world I need to make something great
          that adds value to people's lives. Lacking an Engineering degree I
          sought the easiest (not so easy now) way of becoming an engineer and I
          stumbled into coding. I joined the School of Code and I haven't looked
          back since!
